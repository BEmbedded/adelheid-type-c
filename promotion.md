## Preamble

Hi r/mk!  
Over the past few months I've been working on a fork of /u/FateNozomi's Arisu keyboard and now it's finally complete and I'm ready to share: The **Adelheid**,  the (first?) 75% Alice clone.

Here are the changes compared to the Arisu:

- added an angled &amp; spaced function row
- added a footprint for stepped caps lock support
- replaced the micro usb port with a through hole mini usb port.

Thank you Fate for designing and open-sourcing the Arisu! Obviously this project would not have been possible without your hard work. I'm pleased to say that the Adelheid was almost entirely designed by typing on the Arisu.
